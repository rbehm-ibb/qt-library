/// \brief The IpcComm class implements a serial communication protocol.
///
/// The IpcComm protocol has the following syntax:
/// - __STX__ \<transparent binary data\> __DLE__ __ETX__ \<chksum\>
/// - Response is __ACK__ or __NAK__
/// - \<transparent binary data\> uses DLE doubling
/// - \<chksum\> (8 bit) is the 8 bit sum of all sent bytes (incl STX and ETX, excl additional DLE bytes)
/// - We use printable ctrl chars 'S', 'D', 'E', 'A', 'N' for STX, DLE, ETX, ACK and NAK
/// - The first byte of the data is used a message identifier. Usually this is also a printable ASCII char.
///
/// The receiver is implemented as a state machine. The transmitter just sends all data of a block.
/// There is no risk of tx buffer overflow, since the max block size is 128 bytes and a new block is only sent
/// when the previous has been received by the other end (or it has been aborted).
///
/// The protocol is full duplex. At any time a block can be transmitted in either direction.
/// Responses are always sent after a transmitted block.
///
/// Timeouts are watched for inside a block and while waiting for a response.
/// If a block could not be successfully transmitted (ACK'd by other side) after 5 repeats it is discarded.
///
